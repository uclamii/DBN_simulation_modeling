% Learn Structure of BN from data and K2 algorithm
%
% Input:
%
% data: 2d array of (number of cases, temporal features)
% ns: array that depicts number of categories per variable
% max_fan_in: integer number of allowed edges between variables
% intraLength: integer number of variables
%
%1) Learn intra-strucure, using 1st time point static data (K2)
%
% Output:
% dag: intra-structure, 2d array (number of variables, number of variables) 
%
